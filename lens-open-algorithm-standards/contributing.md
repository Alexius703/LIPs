## How to Contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the ML Open Standards by submitting Pull Requests (PRs) and utilizing the templates provided in each folder for suggesting new entities, models, and services.

### Entities

To propose a new entity, submit a PR using the [entity template](./entities/template.entity.md) to define the entity. Create the file in the `entities` folder using the format `entity_name.entity.md`. If the new entity is approved, the PR will be merged, and a new folder will be created in the `models` directory for the entity.

### Models

To define a new model, submit a PR using the [model template](./models/template.model.md) to describe the model. Place the file under the appropriate entity folder where the model belongs.

### Services

Becoming a service provider and showcasing your services to the Lens ML Open Standards community is the most common way to contribute. To do so, find the entity and model you want to provide a service for, and submit a PR inside the `entity > model > service` folder using the template provided there.
