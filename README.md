# Lens Improvement Proposals (LIPs)

Welcome to the Lens Standards repository. This repository will contain all the open standards that are used by Lens Protocol. The standards are divided into folders. Each folder contains a specific type of standard. For example, the `lens-open-algorithm-standards` folder contains all the standards that are related to the Lens Open Algorithm Standards.

The objective of the LIPs is to establish uniformity and offer comprehensive documentation for Lens, including the conventions and frameworks built on top of it. This repository monitors both completed and ongoing enhancements to Lens through the LIPs.
